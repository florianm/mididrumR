How does a drummer build R packages? With MIDI triggering the package build shortcuts of course.

This (non-)package targets the broad majority of R package developing drummers who
wish to combine the useful (practicing drums on their Yamaha DTXplorer e-drumkit) 
with the fun stuff (documenting, building, testing R packages).

## Installation
View `vignette("install", package="mididrumR")` for in-depth installation steps.

On a Ubuntu system, install `aseqdump` and `xdotool`.

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt install -y aseqdump xdotool
```

Then, deploy a copy of the script, edit, and adjust to taste.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(mididrumR)
deploy_script()
```

Lastly, run `mididrumR.sh`, focus on RStudio, and play drums. Hitting cymbals,
toms or the snare will run various package build commands.
